        <h2>What we believe.</h3>

        <h3>The Bible</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>We believe that the Holy Bible was written by men supernaturally inspired; that it is true, completely without error in its content; Therefore it is, and shall remain to the end of the age, the only complete and final revelation of the will of God to man; the true center of Christian union and the supreme standard by which all human conduct, creeds, and opinions should be tried. By “The Holy Bible” we mean that collection of sixty-six books from Genesis to Revelation, which, as originally written, does not only contain and convey the Word of God, but IS the very Word of God.</li>
          <li>By “inspiration” we mean that the books of the Bible were written by Holy men of old, as they were moved by the Holy Spirit, in such a definite way that their writings were supernatural and verbally inspired and free from error, as no other writings have ever been or ever will be inspired.</li>
          <li>The faithfulness of the King James Version to the original languages (Textus Receptus) makes it the most trustworthy English version available and therefore the most acceptable for use in the ministry of our church. (Psalms 119:7-11; Luke 16:31; Romans 15:4; Psalms 119:89; Luke 24:25-27; Ephesians 6:17; Psalms 119:130; Luke 24:44-45; II Timothy 3:16-17; Psalm 119:105; John 17:17; II Peter 1:19-21; Psalms 119:160; Acts 1:16; Revelation 22:19; Proverbs 30:5-6; Romans 3:4)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>God</h3>
        <p>We believe in 1 Triune God, eternally existing in 3 persons -- Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, each co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory, and having the same attributes and perfections (Deut. 6:4; Matt. 28:19; John 14:10, 26; II Cor. 13:14).</p>

        <h3>Son</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became man, without ceasing to be God, having been conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary, in order that He might reveal God and redeem sinful men (Isa. 7:14; 9:6; Luke 1:35; John 1:1-2, 14; II Cor. 5:19-21; Gal. 4:4-5; Phil. 2:5-8).</li>
          <li>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our redemption through his death on the cross as a representative, vicarious, substitutionary sacrifice; and, that our justification is made sure by His literal, physical resurrection from the dead (Acts 2:18-36; Rom. 3:24-25; Eph. 1:7; I Peter 1:3-5; II Peter 2:24).</li>
          <li>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended to Heaven, and is now exalted at the right hand of God, where, as our High Priest, He fulfills the ministry of Representative, Intercessor, and Advocate (Acts 1:9-10; Rom. 8:34; Heb. 7:25; 9:24; I John 2:1-2).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Holy Spirit</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>We believe that the Holy Spirit is a Person who convicts the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment; and, that He is the Supernatural Agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers into the body of Christ, indwelling and sealing them unto the day of redemption (John 16:8-11; Rom. 8:9; I Cor. 12:12-14; II Cor. 3:6; Eph. 1:13-14).</li>
          <li>We believe the Holy Spirit was active in creation; that in His relation to the unbelieving world He restrains the Evil One until God’s purpose is fulfilled; that He bears witness to the truth of the Gospel in preaching and testimony and that He seals, endues, guides, teaches, witnesses, sanctifies, and otherwise helps the believer (Gen. 1:2; John 14:26; 16:13; Rom. 8:14, 16; Eph. 1:13-14; II Thes. 2:7).</li>
          <li>We believe that He is the Divine Teacher who assists believers to understand and appropriate the Scriptures and that it is the privilege and duty of all the saved to be filled with the Spirit (Eph. 1:17-18; 5:18; I John 2:20, 27).</li>
          <li>We believe that God is sovereign in the bestowal of spiritual gifts to every believer. God uniquely uses evangelists, pastors, and teachers to equip believers in the assembly in order that they can do the work of the ministry (Rom. 12:3-8; I Cor. 12:4-11, 28; Eph. 4:7-12).</li>
          <li>We believe that the sign gifts of the Holy Spirit, such as speaking in tongues and the gift of healing were temporary. We believe that speaking in tongues was never the common or necessary sign of the baptism or filling of the Holy Spirit and that ultimate deliverance of the body from sickness or death awaits the consummation of our salvation in the resurrection, though God frequently chooses to answer the prayers of believers for physical healing (I Cor. 1:22; 13:8; 14:21-31).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Sin and Salvation</h3>
        <p>We believe that man was created in the image and likeness of God, but that in Adam's sin the human race fell, inherited a sinful nature, and became alienated from God; and that man is totally depraved, and of himself, utterly unable to remedy his lost condition. (Gen. 1:26-27; Rom. 3:22-23; 5:12; 6:23; Eph. 2:1-3; 4:17-19).We believe that salvation is the gift of God brought to man by grace and received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, Whose precious blood was shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of our sins (John 1:12; Eph. 1:7; 2:8-10; I Peter 1:18-19).</p>

        <h3>The Eternal Security and Assurance of Believers</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>We believe that all the redeemed, once saved, are kept by God's power and are thus secure in Christ forever (John 6:37-40; 10:27-30; Rom. 8:1, 38-39; I Cor. 1:4-8; I Peter 1:4-5).</li>
          <li>We believe that it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God's Word, which, however, clearly forbids the use of Christian liberty as an occasion to the flesh (Rom. 13:13-14; Gal. 5:13; Titus 1:11-15).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The New Testament Church</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>We believe that the local church, which is the body and the espoused bride of Christ, is solely made up of born-again persons (I Cor. 12:12-14; II Cor. 11:2; Eph. 1:22-23; 5:25-27).</li>
          <li>We believe that the establishment and continuance of local churches is clearly taught and defined in the New Testament Scriptures (Acts 14:27; 20:17, 28-32; I Tim. 3:1-13; Titus 1:5-11).</li>
          <li>We believe in the autonomy of the local church free of any external authority or control (Acts 13:1-4; 15:19-31; 20:28; Rom. 16-1, 4; I Cor. 3:9, 16; 5:4-7, 13; I Peter 5:1-4).</li>
          <li>We recognize water baptism by immersion, in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit and the Lord's Supper as the Scriptural ordinances of obedience for the Church in this age (Matt. 28:19-20; Acts 2:41-42; 18:18; I Cor. 11:23-26).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The Last Days</h3>
        <p>We believe in the pre-tribulational Rapture of the church saints, followed by the seven-year Tribulation. We believe in the pre-millennial return of Christ to the earth and His literal rule of one thousand years. Following this one thousand years is the Great White Throne judgment and then the new Heaven and new earth (I Corinthians 15:51-58; I Thessalonians 4:13-18; I Thessalonians 5:1-9; Revelation 19-22).</p>
